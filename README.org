* Description
This is a work in progress, (probably) one shot /Amphibia/ fanfiction
taking place sometime around the epilogue.

/Amphibia/ is a Disney animated television show originally created by
Matt Braly.

The characters in this particular fanfiction reflect /my/ headcanon,
which is that the characters were /sixteen/ during the events of the
show, rather than /thirteen/, and that /Marcy/ is a hypersexual
/aroallo/.

This /repository/ serves as a way for anybody who wishes to look at my
creative process may do so, and to allow for people to easily create
their own derivatives if they so wish.

* Disclaimer
As one might conclude from the title, this particular fanfiction is
sexually explicit. This also is a fanfiction focused on various types of
/watersports/.

These are the types of watersports you can expect to see:
- Omorashi/Wetting
- Desperation/Holding
- Bladder control (BDSM)
- Piss drinking

If these things are /not/ to your liking, please turn away now.

*You have been warned*

* Writing Tools
For those curious /what/ I use to write, here's a list of my work flow.
At the time of writing, my workflow is still developing, and this
section will likely change semi-frequently.

** Writing: Doom Emacs (evil) + org-mode
I use the doom distribution of the Emacs text editor with vim (evil)
bindings. Both vim and Emacs are plain-text editors that were created
during a period before graphical desktops were common place, and thus
were created with keybindings for navigation and formatting of the text.
I use Emacs because vim (and it's distros, like nvim) are mostly locked
into a terminal window, and thus, is unable take advantage of the
graphical environment. Also, in my experience, Emacs is just more
configurable.

Org mode is a writing mode in Emacs that allows for very powerful
organization tools, such as TODO management. It is also a good
alternative to markdown.

** Draft/Revision Management: git
Git is a version control software that allows me to take snapshots of
a project, which I can then go back to if I want/need to. This removes
the need to keep multiple revisions of a draft on my machine, while
still being able to go back and write. It also has a very useful
/branching/ feature, which is useful if you have multiple people working
on the same project.

** Sharing and Hosting: AO3, GitLab, and GitHub
As I'm sure you've gathered, this project is hosted on both GitLab and
GitHub. But for actually /publishing/ the finalized project for people to
find and read, I've hosted /that/ on [[https://archiveofourown.org/][Archive Of Our Own (AO3)]], because
it's a very popular fanfiction hosting site, and the /only/ one of the
top three that is open source.

* License
Not that this actually means much for a work of fiction that is
/technically/ illegal, such being the case with /all/ fanfiction, I'm
still including this license indicator for the sake of readers and
people who may show interest in continuing what I've written in this
particular story.

While this license statement is most certainly /not legally binding/ due
to the nature of fanfiction, it still serves an important purpose. It is
my understanding that common fanfiction etiquette dictates that you

license above indicates that I explicitly grant /everybody/ permission
to copy my work, as long as they credit me as the author and grant
others the same permissions that I have.
