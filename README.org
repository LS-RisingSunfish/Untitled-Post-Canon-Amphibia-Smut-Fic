* Description
This is a perpetual WIP /Amphibia/ fanfiction taking place sometime
around the show's epilogue.

This is intended to be a fun, slice of life fic about three homos doing
homo things, and there is no intended end point. Each chapter will
(probably) have its own self contained story, and likely be erotic.

It's mostly me writing what I think a possible future for these
characters could be.

This repository serves to allow anybody who wishes to look at my
creative process to do so, and to allow for people to easily create
their own derivatives or adaptations.

Such derivations and adaptations are encouraged, but it is recommended
that any who do so leave any and all legal disclaimers unchanged (I am
not a lawyer, this is not legal advice).

* Disclaimers
Within this 'Disclaimers' section, unless otherwise indicated, usage of
first person pronouns ('I', 'me', 'myself', 'we', etc.) is intended to
refer to individual responsible for managing this git repository,
wherever it is located.

** Legal
/Amphibia/ is a Disney animated television show originally created by
Matt Braly.

I am not the intellectual property rights holder of /Amphibia/.

I have not made any agreement with /Amphibia/'s rights holder which
would grant me any rights to use the intellectual property that is not
consistent with those of a typical viewer.

Any permissions granted by me are not intended to be interpreted as
legally binding licensing agreements or any other such legal agreement
between any number of parties, including myself.

None of the content in this work of fiction is intended to be
interpreted as official media.

None of the events in this work of fiction are intended to be
interpreted as changes or additions to official canon.

The Section with the heading [[#sharing-modification-derivation-and-adaptation][Sharing, Modification, Derivation, and
Adaptation]] contains references to one or more intellectual property
licenses. These are used for /reference and illustrative purposes only/,
and are not intended to form a legally binding contract, licensing
agreement, or other such legal agreement between any number of parties,
including myself.

** Erotic Content
Unless otherwise indicated, all acts described only involve consenting parties.

This work contains (or will contain) explicit depictions/descriptions of:
- Sex
- Wetting
- Desperation/Holding
- BDSM
  - Urine Consumption
  - Bladder Control
  - Free Use

If these things are /not/ to your liking, please turn away now.

The above list will be expanded as new chapters are written.

* Writing Tools
For those curious /what/ I use to write, here's a list of my work flow.
At the time of writing, my workflow is still developing, and this
section will likely change semi-frequently.

** Writing: Doom Emacs (evil) + org-mode
I use the doom distribution of the Emacs text editor with vim (evil)
bindings. Both vim and Emacs are plain-text editors that were created
during a period before graphical desktops were common place, and thus
were created with keybindings for navigation and formatting of the text.
I use Emacs because vim (and it's distros, like nvim) are mostly locked
into a terminal window, and thus, is unable take advantage of the
graphical environment. Also, in my experience, Emacs is just more
configurable.

Org mode is a writing mode in Emacs that allows for very powerful
organization tools, such as TODO management. It is also a good
alternative to markdown.

** Draft/Revision Management: git
Git is a version control software that allows me to take snapshots of
a project, which I can then go back to if I want/need to. This removes
the need to keep multiple revisions of a draft on my machine, while
still being able to go back and write. It also has a very useful
/branching/ feature, which is useful if you have multiple people working
on the same project.

** Sharing and Hosting: AO3, GitLab, and GitHub
As I'm sure you've gathered, this project is hosted on both GitLab and
GitHub. But for actually /publishing/ the finalized project for people to
find and read, I've hosted /that/ on [[https://archiveofourown.org/][Archive Of Our Own (AO3)]], because
it's a very popular fanfiction hosting site, and the /only/ one of the
top three that is open source.

* Sharing, Modification, Derivation, and Adaptation
** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
Even though this means little for a work that's /technically/ illegal,
such being the case with /any/ fanfiction based on work published under
/All Rights Reserved/ (or any other license that prohibits unauthorized
duplication and/or derivation/adaptation), I'm still including this
license statement for the anybody who may be interested in using this
story or its contents.

#+NAME: Creative Commons License

/Untitled Post Canon Amphibia Smut Fic/ by /L;S Rising Sunfish/ has shared under
the terms of [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0][Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International

While this license statement is most certainly /not legally binding/ due
to the nature of fanfiction, it still serves an important purpose. It is
my understanding that common fanfiction etiquette dictates that you
should not copy the work of another without permission. Well, the
license above indicates that I explicitly grant /everybody/ permission
to copy my work, as long as they credit me as the author (Attribution)
and grant others the same permissions that I have (ShareAlike).

To reiterate: The above license statement indicate that you /do not need
to seek my permission/ in order to use my writing /for any reason/. My
only demand is that, /if/ you use it, you attribute me (Attribution),
and then share it under the same terms (ShareAlike).

For those unaware, this is a /copyleft/ license, and in situations where
it is legally binding, (such as /The SCP Foundation/, which is under CC
BY-SA 3.0) it actually prohibits anybody from locking derivatives or
adaptations behind copyright, because the terms dictate that such
derivatives /also/ be licensed under the same license, or one that is
compatible with it (all of which are also copyleft).

** Kopimi
[[./images/kopimi.png]]

Kopimi is a religious symbol used to indicate that I not only /permit/
sharing, duplication, and remixing of my work, but that I explicitly
/request/ that people do so all of those things, /for any reason or
purpose/.
