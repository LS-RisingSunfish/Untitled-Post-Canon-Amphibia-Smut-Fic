* Description
This is a work in progress, (probably) one shot /Amphibia/ fanfiction
taking place sometime around the epilogue.

/Amphibia/ is a Disney animated television show originally created by
Matt Braly.

The characters in this particular fanfiction reflect /my/ headcanon,
which is that the characters were /sixteen/ during the events of the
show, rather than /thirteen/, and that /Marcy/ is a hypersexual
/aroallo/.

This /repository/ serves as a way for anybody who wishes to look at my
creative process may do so, and to allow for people to easily create
their own derivatives if they so wish.

* Disclaimer
As one might conclude from the title, this particular fanfiction is
sexually explicit. This also is a fanfiction focused on various types of
/watersports/.

These are the types of watersports you can expect to see:
- Omorashi/Wetting
- Desperation/Holding
- Bladder control (BDSM)
- Piss drinking

If these things are /not/ to your liking, please turn away now.

*You have been warned*

* License
Not that this actually means much for a work of fiction that is
/technically/ illegal, such being the case with /all/ fanfiction, I'm
still including this license indicator for the sake of readers and
people who may show interest in continuing what I've written in this
particular story.

While this license statement is most certainly /not legally binding/ due
to the nature of fanfiction, it still serves an important purpose. It is
my understanding that common fanfiction etiquette dictates that you
should not copy the work of another without permission. Well, the
license above indicates that I explicitly grant /everybody/ permission
to copy my work, as long as they credit me as the author and grant
others the same permissions that I have.
